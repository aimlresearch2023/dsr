Weekly Status Report: Embedding Layer Optimization
Date: August 29, 2025
Project: Model Optimization

Executive Summary

This week, the team continued research into reducing the number of tokens in the model's embedding layer to enhance efficiency. Significant progress was made by implementing a custom Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer, which has resulted in a substantial reduction in model size and the number of parameters, without compromising accuracy.
Key Accomplishments
    - Parameter and Size Reduction: Successfully reduced the number of parameters in the embedding layer by approximately 83%, from roughly 1,000,000 to about 173,000. This led to a corresponding decrease in the model's size from ~4MB to ~700KB.
    - Maintained Accuracy with Faster Training: The newly trained model achieved the same accuracy as the baseline ELECTRA tokenizer.[1][2] Notably, this accuracy was reached in just 4 epochs, a significant improvement over the 20 epochs required for the previous tokenizer.
    - Custom Tokenizer Training: A BPE tokenizer was trained on our complete dataset with a maximum vocabulary of 4096 tokens. The BPE method inherently handles out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words by breaking them down into known sub-word units.[3][4][5]
Research and Development
    - Our work this week was guided by the techniques outlined in the paper, "Put Teacher in Studentâ€™s Shoes: Cross-Distillation for Ultra-compact Model Compression Framework."[6][7] The paper details a comprehensive framework for model compression, including methods like hard token pruning, which aligns with our current efforts.[7][8][9]
    - The primary focus was on replacing the existing ELECTRA tokenizer with a more compact BPE tokenizer.[10][11] This subword tokenization technique creates a vocabulary from the most frequently occurring character pairs, which is an effective strategy for managing vocabulary size while handling unseen words.[12][13]
Next Steps
    - Continue to explore and implement other model compression techniques from the aforementioned research paper.
    - Conduct further testing to ensure the robustness and performance of the new, more compact model in various scenarios.
    - Begin integrating the optimized model into the deployment pipeline.
