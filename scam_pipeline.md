Step-by-Step Breakdown:

    Data Gathering:
        Purpose: Collect raw SMS data, emails, and other communication data where spam detection is required.
        Tools: Public datasets like SMS Spam Collection Dataset.
        Why it's needed: Without data, the model cannot learn to differentiate spam from non-spam.

    Data Augmentation (Synthetic Data):
        Purpose: To generate synthetic data to increase the size and diversity of the dataset. This is especially helpful when there's a limited dataset.
        Tools: Libraries like Snorkel or manual rule-based augmentations (e.g., altering phrases or injecting new synonyms).
        Why it's needed: Augmented data helps improve the model's generalization and robustness.

    Data Cleaning:
        Purpose: Remove duplicates, irrelevant data, and noise from the dataset.
        Tools: Python libraries like pandas or custom scripts to detect anomalies.
        Why it's needed: Clean data ensures that the model is not learning from bad inputs or irrelevant features.

    Preprocessing (Tokenization, Normalization):
        Purpose: Convert raw text into tokens for the model to process. This may include:
            Lowercasing text.
            Removing special characters.
            Stemming or lemmatizing.
        Tools: Tokenizers from libraries like Hugging Face Tokenizers or spaCy.
        Why it's needed: Preprocessing is essential to convert text into a suitable form for the model, reducing noise and improving learning.

    Named Entity Recognition (NER):
        Purpose: Identify and label entities in text (such as phone numbers, URLs, and other spam indicators).
        Tools: Pre-trained NER models from spaCy or Transformers.
        Why it's needed: NER helps capture critical patterns and context for spam, such as recognizing keywords often used in spam messages.

    Model Training & Fine-tuning (Using Electra):
        Purpose: Train or fine-tune an Electra-based model using preprocessed data for spam classification.
        Tools: Hugging Face Transformers for Electra model fine-tuning.
        Why it's needed: Fine-tuning adjusts the pre-trained model weights to suit the specific spam classification task.

    Model Pruning & Quantization:
        Purpose: Reduce the size of the trained model by removing redundant parameters (pruning) and reducing precision (quantization) for faster inference on edge devices.
        Tools: Hugging Face Optimum or TensorFlow Lite.
        Why it's needed: Pruning and quantization help deploy the model on devices with limited resources without sacrificing much accuracy.

    Deployment on Mobile Device:
        Purpose: Deploy the quantized model on mobile devices or other edge devices.
        Tools: Frameworks like TensorFlow Lite or ONNX Runtime.
        Why it's needed: Running inference on a mobile device provides real-time spam detection.

    Inference & Spam Classification:
        Purpose: The model classifies incoming messages as spam or not in real time.
        Tools: Optimized inference engines like TensorFlow Lite or ONNX runtime.
        Why it's needed: The end goal is to identify and filter spam messages effectively on the user’s device.
